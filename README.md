Swagger Example
=================

This is an example of how to use the connexion package from Zalando.
Connexion is a framework integrating Swagger (UI) and Flask.

This is mainly for internal / evaluation purposes, but you should feel free
to play around.

Necessary to get started:

0) Prerequisites / Virtualenv

`python3 -m venv v`

`source env/bin/activate`

1) Installation of requirements

The obligatory `pip install -r requirements.txt`

2) Start the app

`python app.py` to start the app.

`localhost:8000/participants` lists example data.

The Path for Swagger is `localhost:8000/ui`.
